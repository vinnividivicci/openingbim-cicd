# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The BIM/IDS Validation Tool extends the existing BIM viewer application to enable validation of Building Information Modeling (BIM) data from loaded IFC files against Information Delivery Specification (IDS) requirements. Building on the current 3D viewer with IFC loading capabilities, the tool will add IDS validation functionality while maintaining the client-side processing approach and providing comprehensive validation results with interactive 3D visualization.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a BIM professional, I want to load IDS specification files into the existing BIM viewer, so that I can define validation criteria for my already-loaded IFC models.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an IFC model is loaded in the viewer THEN the system SHALL enable IDS file loading functionality
2. WHEN a user accesses the models panel THEN the system SHALL provide an option to load IDS files
3. WHEN a user selects an IDS file THEN the system SHALL parse and validate the IDS specification format
4. WHEN an IDS file is successfully loaded THEN the system SHALL store the specification for validation use
5. WHEN multiple IDS files are loaded THEN the system SHALL manage them as separate validation specifications

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a quality assurance professional, I want to run IDS validation against loaded IFC models, so that I can identify compliance issues using the existing viewer interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN both IFC models and IDS specifications are loaded THEN the system SHALL provide a validation execution interface
2. WHEN a user initiates validation THEN the system SHALL process all loaded IFC models against all loaded IDS specifications
3. WHEN validation is running THEN the system SHALL display progress feedback to the user
4. WHEN validation completes THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive results for each specification
5. WHEN validation encounters errors THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and continue processing other specifications

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a construction stakeholder, I want to view detailed validation results in the existing interface, so that I can understand compliance issues without learning a new tool.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation completes THEN the system SHALL display results in a new panel section within the existing grid layout
2. WHEN results are available THEN the system SHALL organize them by IDS specification and individual requirements
3. WHEN requirements pass validation THEN the system SHALL display them with clear success indicators
4. WHEN requirements fail validation THEN the system SHALL display them with failure counts and detailed element lists
5. WHEN no validation has been run THEN the system SHALL display appropriate placeholder content in the results panel

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a BIM coordinator, I want to interact with validation results using the existing 3D viewer capabilities, so that I can visually locate and understand problematic elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation identifies failing elements THEN the system SHALL use the existing highlighter component to mark them in the 3D viewer
2. WHEN a user clicks on a failing element in the results THEN the system SHALL select and focus that element using existing camera controls
3. WHEN elements are highlighted for validation THEN the system SHALL use distinct colors from other highlighting (measurements, selections)
4. WHEN validation results change THEN the system SHALL clear previous validation highlighting before applying new results
5. WHEN users interact with validation highlights THEN the system SHALL integrate with existing selection and isolation tools

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to export validation results for reporting, so that I can share findings with stakeholders and maintain compliance documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation results are available THEN the system SHALL provide export functionality within the results panel
2. WHEN a user initiates export THEN the system SHALL generate a comprehensive report including all validation results
3. WHEN export completes THEN the system SHALL provide the report file for download
4. WHEN no validation results exist THEN the system SHALL disable or hide export functionality
5. WHEN export encounters errors THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages to the user

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a BIM professional, I want the IDS validation to integrate seamlessly with the existing application architecture, so that I can use familiar workflows and maintain data privacy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN IDS validation is added THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing client-side processing approach
2. WHEN validation occurs THEN the system SHALL use the existing component architecture and state management
3. WHEN IDS files are processed THEN the system SHALL not transmit any data to external servers
4. WHEN validation integrates THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with existing IFC loading and fragment management
5. WHEN new functionality is added THEN the system SHALL follow the established UI template patterns and styling

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the validation functionality to extend the current grid layout system, so that I can manage validation alongside existing model management features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation functionality is added THEN the system SHALL integrate with the existing content grid layout
2. WHEN validation panels are displayed THEN the system SHALL follow the established panel section patterns
3. WHEN validation state changes THEN the system SHALL update the interface using the existing BUI component system
4. WHEN validation tools are accessed THEN the system SHALL maintain the current responsive design principles
5. WHEN validation features are used THEN the system SHALL preserve the existing keyboard shortcuts and interaction patterns
